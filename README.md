# Housing Price Prediction

This project aims to predict housing prices based on square footage using linear regression. The dataset consists of housing data with features such as square meters and corresponding prices. The goal is to build a regression model that can accurately predict housing prices based on square footage.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis library.
- Numpy: Numerical computing library for handling arrays and mathematical operations.
- Matplotlib: Data visualization library for creating plots and charts.
- Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for implementing regression models.
- Seaborn: Statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib.
- Scipy: Scientific computing library for statistical functions and operations.

## Project Steps
1. Data Preparation: Load the housing dataset using Pandas, and perform any necessary data cleaning or preprocessing steps.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Use Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize the data and gain insights into the relationship between square footage and housing prices.
3. Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets using Scikit-learn's train_test_split function.
4. Model Training: Build a linear regression model using Scikit-learn's LinearRegression class and fit it to the training data.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance by calculating metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared using Scikit-learn and Scipy.
6. Predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data and assess its accuracy in predicting housing prices based on square footage.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you can follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/luiscopete/houseprice_prediction.git`  
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy`, `pip install -U scikit-learn`
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to access the code.
4. Run the code step by step or execute the entire script to perform housing price prediction based on square footage.

Feel free to modify the code, dataset, or experiment with different regression models to further improve the predictions.
